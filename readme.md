Proof Carrying Code for MiniML
==============================
The idea is to create PCC framework for MiniML - subset of OCaml Light language.

Current status
==============
Implementing MiniML compiler to simple asembly language.

Currently working on
====================
* Graph Code Language (see feature/languages/graph-code)
